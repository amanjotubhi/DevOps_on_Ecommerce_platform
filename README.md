üõ†Ô∏è End-to-End DevOps Implementation for Open-Source E-Commerce Application

This repository documents a complete DevOps implementation for an open-source e-commerce application built with multiple microservices. The focus is on deploying the application on AWS using containerization, orchestration, infrastructure-as-code, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project uses an open-source e-commerce codebase as the application layer. This repository focuses entirely on the DevOps infrastructure and automation built around it.
